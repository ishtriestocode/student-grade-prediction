Student Grade Prediction
Welcome to the Student Grade Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict students' grades using machine learning techniques.

Overview
This project seeks to address the critical need for early identification of students who may be at risk of academic underachievement. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to develop a model capable of accurately predicting students' grades based on a variety of factors, including study habits, socio-economic background, and past academic performance. The insights generated by this model can empower educators to intervene proactively and provide targeted support to students in need, thereby fostering academic success and reducing dropout rates.

Project Structure
Data: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
Analysis: Provides detailed insights gained from exploratory data analysis to better understand the underlying patterns and correlations within the dataset.
Modeling: Encompasses the development and training of machine learning models tailored specifically for predicting student grades.
Evaluation: Summarizes the evaluation results of the trained models, including key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Explores potential strategies for deploying the model in educational settings to facilitate its integration into existing systems and workflows.


Requirements
To run this project, you'll need:

Python 3.x
Pandas
